## Bootcamp Project 1 (HTML, CSS, JS, API)
For our first project, we developed a SuperHero web app where you can search for characters by themes. 

### Homepage
When the homepage loads, the banner image and the theme icons will be displayed on the screen. Available themes are: OG Avengers, Villains, Sheroes, Heroes. When the user selects a theme, the page will diplay 4 characters tagged with that theme. When the user clicks on the character, the interior page will display. We used the SuperHero API to pull the character name, character id, and character image using Javascript. *(more info will be added here when we are done with our JS files)*

### Interior Page
The interior page will display data based on the URL parameter which contains the character ID. Character-specific information such as hero name, real name, and city of origin/organization will display on the page. There will also be a "read more" button which will pop open a modal window with a list of movies the character appears in. We also used the SuperHero API here to pull the character name, image, and place of birth. Then we used the TMDB API to pull the movies related to the character selected. *(more info will be added here when we are done with our JS files)*

### Modal Window
The character-specific modal window will display the movie image, title and year. We used the TMDB API to pull the movies matching the character selected. *(more info will be added here when we are done with our JS files)*
